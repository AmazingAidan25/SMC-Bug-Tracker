# SMC-Bug-Tracker
Hello all! Thank you for taking the time to create a bug report! Here is how you properly format a bug report so the devs can easily understand what the issue is and what to fix! 

To start, click the **"Issues"** tab at the top, then click **"New Issue."** Create a title that briefly describes the issue (Let's say that you were unable to activate your elytra in Ace Race. You would type **"Elytras won't activate in Ace Race"** as the title.) Then by copying and pasting the template below, list out all the information that is required and then click submit on the issue. A status indicator will show when a bug is open or has been resolved. Thank you once again for taking the time to create a bug report for us!




**TEMPLATE:**

Describe your issue:  

When did you have this issue: 

What is your Discord Username (**abcd#1234**):  

Which game is this bug relevant in: 

Can this be replicated (is it an issue that comes up multiple times?):
